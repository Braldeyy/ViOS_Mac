**Prototype:**

```c
void sys_exit(int exit_code);
```

**Type:** `System Call`

*   `int exit_code` â€” The exit status code to return to the parent process

Returns
-------

This system call does not return as it terminates the current process.

Notes
-----

- System call number: `SYSTEM_COMMAND0_EXIT` (0)

- The exit code is typically 0 for successful termination, non-zero for errors
- After calling this system call, the process resources are cleaned up by the kernel
